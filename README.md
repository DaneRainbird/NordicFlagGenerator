# Nordic Flag Generator
A simple NodeJS webapp that creates a random [Nordic Cross Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_cross_flag) with a fictitious country name generated by a Markov Chain.

Supports providing a seed for the Markov Chain in order to produce deterministic results, if desired.

## Setup / Running
- Run `npm install` to download the required dependencies.
- Create a file named `.env` and create a key called PORT, which the app will run at (defaults to 8080).
- Run `node .\app.js` and navigate to `localhost:8080`, or whichever port you chose.

## Modifying the Results from the  Markov Chain
If you wish to change the potential results that can be generated per name, you can edit the `countries.txt` file within the `res` directory. 

By default, this file contains a list of all real-world Nordic / Scandinavian countries, as well as the names of various locations from Nordic folklore.
